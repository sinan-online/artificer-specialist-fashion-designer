\title{Fashion Designer: A Specialization for Artificers}

\subsection{Fashion Designer: A Specialization for Artificers}

The fashion designer is able to use fabrics, textiles and other wearable materials to generate social effects.

\subsubsection{Tool Proficiency}

Starting at the 3rd level, the fashion designer gains proficiency with weaver's tools.\
% TODO: Add reference to the homebrew document.
If they already have this proficiency, they can gain proficiency in leatherworker's tools or cobbler's tools.

\subsubsection{Artisan's Eye}
The fashion designer has an eye for what people wear and how they carry themselves.
Whenever a check is related to fashion, clothes or accessories, they add a $d6$ to their roll.
This roll increases to $d8$ at the 5th level, $d10$ at the 10th level, $d12$ at the 15th level.
This die stacks with both \emph{Bless} and the bardic inspiration.\par

For example, the fashion designer can add this die to Int (Investigation) rolls to find out details of a character,
or Cha (Persuasion) rolls to show they use their garments and how they present themselves to get what they want out of social situations.\par

\subsubsection{Fashion Designer Spells}

\subsubsection{Designs (Infusions)}

Beginning at the 3rd level, the fashion designer has access to the following ``designs''.
Designs work as artificer infusions.
At the 3rd level, the designer can swap their known infusions for these designs.
Every time the fashion designer gains a level, they can swap their knowns designs or infusions for other designs.
The total number of designs that they know is determined by the ``infusions known'' table.\par

For gameplay purposes, the following infusions from ``Eberron: Rising from the Last War'' count as designs and the fashion designer can choose them:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Boots of the Winding Path
\end{itemize}

The following infusions from ``Eberron: Rising from the Last War'' are modified as described below:
\paragraph{Resistant Armor}
As an fashion design, this infusion can also be used on clothes, not just armor.


\paragraph{Homonculus Servant}
